# Social-Prediction-Task

Code from internship @ Northeastern ABSLAB, June 2019 to August 2020.

Written in JavaScript and HTML, incorporating jsPsych, a JS framework for behavioral experiments.

The social prediction experiment is designed to explore subjects' tendencies to internalize moving shapes as social creatures rather than physical objects. The task, which was formerly hosted on abslabnu.com via s3/lambda, collects response data including predicted movement direction, reaction time, and subjects' written interpretation of the stimulus. The subject data is stored as a .JSON file automatically using an AWS REST API for convenient analysis and modeling in Microsoft Excel.
